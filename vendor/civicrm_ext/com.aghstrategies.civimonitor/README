This is a CiviCRM extension to make it possible for a Nagios monitoring system to track the functioning of a CiviCRM site.  Initially, services tracked are:
- whether CiviCRM is up-to-date
- how recently cron has run
- extensions that are out-of-date
- what the mailing backend is
- if a payment processor is set up
- if CiviCRM's system check produces any notices

After installing this extension, copy check_civicrm.php to your Nagios server, set up commands calling:
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ cron
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ version
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ paymentprocessors
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ extensions
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ mailing
- /usr/bin/php path-to-nagios-plugins/check_civicrm.php $HOSTADDRESS$ $_HOSTHTTP$ $_HOSTCMS$ $_HOSTSITE_KEY$ $_HOSTAPI_KEY$ system

and then services for the appropriate host(s) and/or hostgroup(s) that call those commands.

The contact used in the API request must have either "Administer CiviCRM" or "Access CiviMonitor" permissions.
